We will learn about various ways you can store data later through Data structures and Data types.Programming languages like c, c++ which are called low level languages use memory allocation functions like malloc() , realloc() and to free that memory, they use free(). High level programming languages like python, Java and Go uses Garbage collector where memory is managed by the programming laanguage itself.\nWhy do we need to manage memory? Performance and security are the main reasons.
